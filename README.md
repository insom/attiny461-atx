=============

This is a simple project, originally started from [Markus Konrad's ATtiny instructable][i], to emulate the semantics of the ATX power button:

* If the power is off, turn it on when the button is pressed.
* If the power is on, don't turn off on a single press.
* If the power is on and the button is held for 6 seconds, turn the power off.
* If the button is held after the power has been turned off, don't turn on until it's released first.
